# mazerun-8086
A maze game created in asm for 8086 using emu8086.
You can run the `Main.asm` file in `Emu8086`. It will run successfully, but that will be very slow hence not playable.

Instead of that, either compile that asm file into an executable using `Emu8086` or use the already compiled `Main.exe` file and run it using
`DOSBox`.
